# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This repo contains all parts of the Week 4 course project for the class Getting and Cleaning Data.

CodeBook.md describes the raw data set, how the raw data was collected, and describes the different variables used.

run_analysis.R contains the code used to download and clean up the data as well as a description of each step taken to do so.

tidydata.txt is the final data set that has been tidied and contains only the requested information.
